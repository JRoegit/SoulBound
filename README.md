# Soul Bound
Soul Bound is a fast-paced single-player puzzle game where the player controls two different characters and has to swap control between them in order to progress through the levels. Our goal is to provide players with a thrilling gaming experience where the player will have to think swiftly under pressure in order to solve puzzles and overcome challenges. Creating a sense of peril in the gameplay not only accelerates the pace of puzzles but also intensifies the pressure on players. This introduces an added layer of complexity to the game, requiring the player to manage various game mechanics while unraveling puzzles. By incorporating a swapping mechanic, players must use their critical thinking skills and rapid decision-making abilities to progress throughout the game. In the presence of danger, the player will have the ability to fight enemies via a rather simple combat system consisting of a sword/shield and bow. Successfully defeating enemies and solving puzzles progresses the player to the next level, evoking a profound sense of pride and accomplishment.

## Overview
In this fast-paced single-player puzzle game, players immerse themselves in a captivating fantasy narrative as they control two inseparable characters, a knight and a princess. The primary goal is their heartwarming reunion, which serves as the emotional core of the game’s cliché romance story. The two face a difficult journey through a mystical realm infested with monsters such as goblins, skeletons, and a dragon as the final boss. The combat mechanics are elegantly simple, with one character wielding a sword and shield for close-quarters engagements while the other uses a bow and arrow as a projectile attack. These elements create a dynamic interplay between combat and puzzle solving ensuring a seamless blend of action and strategy.

## Unique Features
The game introduces novel mechanics such as:

Solo player control of both main characters, requiring strategic swapping between them.
A shared health bar between characters, emphasizing the importance of managing both characters' safety.
Gradual progression of character reunification throughout levels.
Real-time health updates providing information on the inactive character's status.
Gameplay
